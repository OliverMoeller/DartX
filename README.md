# DartX

A) Functionalities:

	In general this should be a software making the Dart play more comfortable by counting points, telling you what to throw, ect.
	Secondarily it should provide several game modes, so it can be used as a sort of training-software. 
	The focus should be on simplicity for the user, especially when it comes to register new results after each throw. 

	1. Singleplayer
		- Only offline.
		- Several game modes such as 301,501,701, Double Training, etc.
		- GUI representing your score.

	2. Multiplayer
   	     	- Connecting two players using the client-server architecture.
		- Provide several game modes to compete with each other. 
		- Live display of the gamescore

	3. Possible features
		- Dartboard in the GUI, so you only mouseclick where your dart landed and it will automaticaly count the points. 
		- Count how many times you hit which number and then the display the hotspots (locations you often hit) on a graphical dartboard.
		- Track "All-Time-Statistics"
		[- Extension to a network application that can be used by anyone. (Need of a server)]
